        <h2>OKAY MR.BATMAN, GO PROTECT THE CITY, WHY AM I READING THIS?!!</h2>
        <p>Well, that's good quesion MR. citizen, to be a good hacker you need to find vulnerabilities, and to do so, you need to know the things where vulnerabilities are in, which
            can be web applications therefore mastering coding is important :D <br>
            So, I'm planning to create 10 projects with different ideas that help me to obtian enough knowledge regarding web application development in order to protect them <br><br>
            <B>BY THE WAY</B>, I would not be able to know this only by Allah then The Engineer Ebrahim Hegazy, he is the best!
